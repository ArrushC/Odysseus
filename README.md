# Odysseus
This application is an AI-powered journey planner that enables users to plan their trips based on the query they provide. The application uses the Gemini API to provide the user with the best route to their destination.

## Why Odysseus?
One of the main reasons why we decided to create this application is to help users plan their trips in a more efficient way. We believe that the current journey planning applications are not as efficient as they could be, and we wanted to create an application that would help users plan their trips in a more streamlined manner.

Furthermore, this application serves as a proof of concept and a demonstration of the capabilities of integrating AI into travel applications. Companies working in the travel industry will view this application as a testament to AI being able to interact with business logic and travel data to provide users with a more efficient and personalized experience.
